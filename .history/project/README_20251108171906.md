#  Django Signals Project – Accuknox Trainee Task

This project demonstrates **Django Signals** behavior and a **custom Python class** implementation as part of the Accuknox Django Trainee Assessment.

## Features

### 1️. Django Signals Tests

#### 🧠 Questions Covered
| Question | Description | Proof |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Q1 | Are Django signals synchronous or asynchronous? | Demonstrated via timing and thread output |
| Q2 | Do signals run in the same thread as the caller? | Verified using `threading.current_thread()` |
| Q3 | Do signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? | Proven using `transaction.set_rollback(True)` |

####  Endpoints
| URL                   |      Description |

| `/create_demo/`       | Tests synchronous execution |
| `/thread_demo/`     | Tests if signals run in the same thread |
| `/transaction_demo/` | Tests database transaction behavior |

### 2️. Custom Python Class

**File:** `rectangle_class.py`

Implements a `Rectangle` class that:
- Accepts `length` and `width` during initialization
- Can be iterated to yield:
  ```python
  {'length': value}
  {'width': value}
